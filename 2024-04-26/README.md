The infamous Mallox is the digital Robin Hoods of our time, except they steal from everyone and give to themselves. Since mid-2021, they've been playing hide and seek with unsecured Microsoft SQL servers, encrypting data, and then graciously offering to give it back for a modest Bitcoin donation. 

Mallox decided to go shopping for new malware toys, adding the Remcos RAT, BatCloak, and a sprinkle of Metasploit to their collection. They're now playing a game of "Catch me if you can" with antivirus software, using their FUD obfuscator packers to turn their ransomware into the digital equivalent of a ninja.
