The action of the next cyber saga takes place in the mystical lands of the Asia-Pacific region, where the main characters (or antagonists, depending on your view of data privacy and the need for access to them) began their digital activities in the middle of 2021 and qualitatively strengthened it in 2022.

In October 2022, Dark Pink tried to attract the European government development agency working in Vietnam with their digital charms. Alas, their attempts were rejected, and the attack was deemed unsuccessful. But did it stop them? Of course not. Armed with an arsenal of tools and specially designed malicious software designed for data theft and espionage, Dark Pink was the epitome of perseverance. Their favorite weapon? Phishing emails containing an abbreviated URL that led victims to a free file-sharing site, where an ISO image was waiting for them, of course malicious.

Let's delve into the goals of cyber artists. Corporate espionage, document theft, audio recordings, and data leaks from messaging platforms were all a matter of one day for Dark Pink. Their geographical focus may have started in the Asia-Pacific region, but their ambitions knew no bounds, targeting a European government ministry in a bold move to expand their portfolio. Their victim profile was as diverse as a UN meeting, targeting military organizations, government agencies, and even a religious organization. Because discrimination is not a fashionable agenda.

In the world of cybercrime, they serve as a reminder that sometimes the most serious threats come in the most unassuming packages with a pink bow.
