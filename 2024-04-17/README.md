Unpacking in more detail: see pdf

Let's all raise our glasses to 2023, the year when ransomware groups threw a non-stop party, smashing records like they were cheap champagne glasses at a billionaire's wedding. With a staggering 4,368 victims caught in their digital nets, these cyber buccaneers managed to outdo themselves, marking a 55.5% increase from the previous year. 

The MVPs of this cyber heist extravaganza? None other than the notorious LockBit3.0, ALPHV, and Cl0p, who, in Q2, decided to go on a hacking spree, compromising 1,386 victims worldwide. Despite the valiant efforts of global law enforcement, these cybercriminals seem to be on an unstoppable roll.
Now, let's talk money, because, at the end of the day, that's what it's all about, right? The average enterprise ransom payment soared to over $100,000, with demands averaging a cool $5.3 million. But here's the kicker: 80% of organizations have a "Do-Not-Pay" policy, and yet, 41% ended up paying the ransom last year. It's like saying you're on a diet but then eating a whole cake because it looked at you funny.

And for those thinking insurance might save the day, think again. A whopping 77% of organizations found out the hard way that ransomware is the party crasher not covered by their security insurance. It's like showing up to a hurricane with an umbrella.

With Ransomware as a Service (RaaS) making it easier for any wannabe cybercriminal to join the fun, we can only expect more chaos, more victims, and more snarky retellings like this one. So, here's to 2023, a year that will be remembered not for technological breakthroughs or cyber defense victories, but for the sheer audacity and success of ransomware groups. May 2024 be a bit less... successful for them.

We will analyze in detail the public materials on ransomware for the third quarter of 2023, delving into various aspects of the current situation, changing trends in attacks, industries and the geography of the phenomenon. The materials make it possible not only to assess the quantitative factors of incidents, but also to provide a qualitative synthesis of these tactics used by attackers and the consequences for cybersecurity strategies in the future. The purpose of the analysis is to provide readers with useful information and a deeper understanding of the phenomenon of ransomware in its current form and its trajectory in the field of cybersecurity
